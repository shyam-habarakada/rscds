rscds
=====

A really simple continuous deployment (continuous integration) server. 

How to use RSCDS
----------------

1. Install nodeJS on your linux server
2. Copy and modify this script to match your site configuration and domain(s)
   - Specifically, edit the site_key to match the site_key you've specified in the github post recieve hook url, and
   - edit the siteMap in the node server script to map to that site key and repo branches that you want to setup for continuous deployment.
3. Add a post recieve hook to your github repo and point it to your node server URL. The webhook URL must be like

    http://www.yourdomain.com:8088/update?site=wwws&secret_key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    
where, wwwstage is a site defined in your siteMap.

4. Start the node server

Ideally, you want to configure the node server to run as a daemon.
